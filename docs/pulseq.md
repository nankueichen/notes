# GUI for pulseq programming
`2024-11-10`

- my thoughts so far
    - I will first use Dash to write a GUI for creating MRI pulse sequences; probably in the format of PANDAS data frame
    - I will use plotly to display sequences

- Some work has been done by other groups:

- I think Dash (based on Flask) is a good platform to use. There have been some successful examples that use Flask or Dash:
    - Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, LinkedIn, Netflix (Flask)

- The APP could be sited in several places, such as
